# Question Tracker app
The goal of this app is to keep track of all the questions done by me Yash Tripathi and the time taken to complete each question across multiple days if applicable.

## Current tasks for the app
- record the start and end for each question
- record the question which was being completed
- record the solution which i created for the given question
- if applicable record multiple approaches for the same question
- save the data about the time and question in a csv file 
- csv file format will be as follows
- - question name, question url, start date, start time, end date, end time, total time in min, total time in sec, solved(bool), Solution Path Array(will get the paths to the various solutions appended to it), etc
- - if the data is not available at the moment for any particular field just use NULL.


## Future works which could be added to the app 

- have the data saved on the cloud and have the app hosted somewhere so that it could be accessed from anywhere
- add users to the app so that the data can have some unique identifying features to it
- add some sort of ai to it (idk anything would work i just want to see how hard it is to deploy an ai and integrate it with an app).
